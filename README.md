# Basic Neural Network

Basic neural network with one hidden layer. Network takes in 2 inputs, and generates one continuous output.

Each synpase uses a [sigmoid activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function).

Gradient descent is done by a [BFGS algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm)

## Future
- add more layers
- create real training data
- create real test data
- split file into multiple files
